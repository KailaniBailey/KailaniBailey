# Hi! I’m Kailani.
I'm a Modern Language (B.A.) graduate who loves spending her free time listening to music while studying Data Science, Analytics, and learning the ins and outs of LLMs. I originally joined Github in 2016 while I was participating in an [Information Science internship](https://www.i3-inclusion.org/about/), held at the School of Computing and Information at the University of Pittsburgh, which lasted from 2016 to 2017... 
nothing came of that first page but (if you're super analytical, like me, and need further proof) it can be found [@KailaniBayy](https://github.com/KailaniBayy). 

The Basics:
-  I love data science, linguistics, language learning, painting, sports and traveling.
-  **My latest project is:** [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://github.com/KailaniBailey/IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Certificate)
-  **Business Questions?** View my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kailanibayy) profile and contact me there *OR* reach me on X [@KailaniBayy](https://x.com/kailanibayy).  


Lastly, A quote from one of my favorite childhood flicks:
<br>
> ["I laugh in the face of Danger!"](https://youtu.be/FvZ649kW3jM?feature=shared) 
<br>- The Lion King <br>

**Note:** The hyenas symbolize so much... anyways... back to work. <3

However, there are drawbacks to their deployment. First and foremost, the cost of high-fidelity task trainers is prohibitively expensive for many programs. Additionally, the combination of manikin-to-learner and teacher-to-learner ratios often makes it difficult to efficiently teach procedures to a large number of students. This project aims to create a low-cost, game-based, easily portable task trainer to assist learners in building skills and expertise in performing bronchoscopies. This preliminary report focuses on designing a motion capture device to record hand, wrist, and thumb motions performed by experts and learners during simulated bronchoscopy procedures and then using this captured data to construct computational feedback models…” |
