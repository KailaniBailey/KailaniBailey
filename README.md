# Hi, I’m [@KailaniBailey](https://github.com/KailaniBailey) on Github
Congrats on finding an appropriate website/app to cyber-stalk me on! ^-^
-  I love data science, linguistics, language learning, sports and traveling.
-  My latest project is: [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://github.com/KailaniBailey/IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Certificate)
-  **Business Questions?** View my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kailanibayy) profile *OR* reach me on **X @KailaniBayy** otherwise... don't bother.

Featuring a quote from one of my favorite childhood flicks:<br><br>["I laugh in the face of Danger!"](https://youtu.be/FvZ649kW3jM?feature=shared) 
<br>- The Lion King <br><br>
**Note:** The hyenas symbolize so much... anyways... back to work. <3
