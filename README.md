# Hi, I’m [@KailaniBailey](https://github.com/KailaniBailey) on Github
-  Congrats on finding an appropriate website/app to cyber-stalk me on! ^-^
-  I love data science, linguistics, language learning, sports and traveling.
-  Business Questions? View my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kailanibayy) profile *OR* reach me on **X @KailaniBayy** otherwise... don't bother.
-  My latest project is: [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://github.com/KailaniBailey/IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Certificate) because I completed my 7-year "social experiment." LOL.
    - In case you're broke and want some pointers for proper SEO (online marketing)... Here's an article: [How to Be a Cam Girl and Make Money Camming Online in 2024](https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/565642/cam-girl/).
    - I've since repented and how come to realize that God always forgives. Ya'll absolutely *do not*... anyways... back to coding.
