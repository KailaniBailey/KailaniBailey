# Hi, I’m [@KailaniBailey](https://github.com/KailaniBailey) on Github
-  Congrats on finding an appropriate website/app to cyber-stalk me on! ^-^
-  I love data science, linguistics, language learning, sports and traveling.
-  Business Questions? View my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kailanibayy) profile *OR* reach me on **X @KailaniBayy** otherwise... don't bother.
-  My latest project is: [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://github.com/KailaniBailey/IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Certificate)

**Note:** I completed my 7-year "social experiment" when I was 29. LOL. This "social experiment" was basically me trying to become cyber-famous so I'd eventually be featured as a pink-haired character in some futuristic video game. Also, the money was cool... I followed my time frame and made a decent amount of moolah in the process, however, I've also acquired a cult following of rude 'fans' who enjoy cyber-bullying and screenshotting whatever residue still remains of my art project. I'm comfortable with my decisions and people still love me. God died on the cross for our sins and already knew it would be a part of my story. I'm aware that every follower is different. I, however, do not care about pleasantries. So... in case you're broke and want some pointers for proper SEO (online marketing)... here's an article for a side-hustle that may or may not ruin your people-pleasing reputation: [How to Be a Cam Girl and Make Money Camming Online in 2024](https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/565642/cam-girl/). I've since repented and how come to realize that God always forgives. Some folks absolutely *do not*... and that's between them and God. I no longer am that person and have moved on. DMCA notices are a thing for a reason. Anyways... back to coding. ^-^
