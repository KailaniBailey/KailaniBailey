## About Me
I'm a Data Scientist, Junior Cybersecurity Analyst, CCMA and Modern Language (B.A.) graduate who loves spending her free time listening to music while consistently learning about Data Science, analytics, and studying the ins and outs of LLMs. I also love traveling, sports, studying languages, painting, reading and enjoying life offline.
