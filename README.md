<br>I'm a Modern Language (B.A.) graduate who loves spending her free time listening to music while studying Data Science, Analytics, and learning the ins and outs of LLMs. I originally joined Github in 2016 while I was participating in an [Information Science internship](https://www.i3-inclusion.org/about/), held at the School of Computing and Information at the University of Pittsburgh, which lasted from 2016 to 2017... 
nothing came of that first page but (if you're super analytical, like me, and need further proof) it can be found [@KailaniBayy](https://github.com/KailaniBayy).

However, there are drawbacks to their deployment. First and foremost, the cost of high-fidelity task trainers is prohibitively expensive for many programs. Additionally, the combination of manikin-to-learner and teacher-to-learner ratios often makes it difficult to efficiently teach procedures to a large number of students. This project aims to create a low-cost, game-based, easily portable task trainer to assist learners in building skills and expertise in performing bronchoscopies. This preliminary report focuses on designing a motion capture device to record hand, wrist, and thumb motions performed by experts and learners during simulated bronchoscopy procedures and then using this captured data to construct computational feedback models…” |

If so, how do you handle these types of situations? Do you continue to stand around and feel anxious? Do you excuse yourself, find a quiet spot, and recover? One piece of advice I received a few years back involves taking care of one’s mental health by ‘stepping away’ from stressful moments to recuperate, or ‘center’ one’s self…” |

Often times it’s understood that if you have anxiety then you can’t sit still or think ‘straight’ for more than a few minutes at a time. Anxiety also has the tendency to surface and show itself in more ways than one. You might feel more anxious and upset one day while feeling more sad and isolated the next. Either way, it’s important for you to know that you are not alone and there are ways to distract yourself when feeling overly anxious…” |

For example, previous research findings support the idea that a healthy cycle of journaling strengthens immune cells- the cells involved in defending our body against diseases- and even helps to decrease symptoms of asthma…” |

How do you feel when thinking about this? What makes you want to practice self-love? What makes you feel like you can’t practice it enough? In February 2015, national-award winning performance poet and author, Caira Lee, stood in front of a large crowd as she delivered a speech at Shaker Heights High School (SHHS). She opened the speech with a live performance, standing and delivering one of her poems to the audience. In this poem, she states what she would say to her fifteen-year-old self…” |

Research shows there are many positive benefits to humming. One article, recently published in Psychology Today, lists a few of the major positive outcomes when one spends at least 20 seconds a day humming…” |
